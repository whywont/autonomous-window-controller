# Autonomous Window Controller

**Smart Sliding Window Automation System**

This project is a smart home device that automatically opens and closes a sliding-glass window based on environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, and light â€” or via manual control through an Android app. The system uses an Arduino microcontroller, a 12V worm gear motor, and various sensors to implement both manual and context-aware automation.

Designed for affordability, modularity, and compatibility with most sliding windows.

## Demo Video


[![Watch the demo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/INwDxqb18yk/hqdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/INwDxqb18yk)

There is a 10 second cooldown required to wait between actions (open/close) and that is removed from the video for brevity. 

## Features

- Automatically opens/closes a window based on:
  - Temperature
  - Humidity
  - Light intensity
- Manual control via Bluetooth Android app
- IR sensor-based window position detection
- Persistent settings stored in Arduino EEPROM
- Configurable sensor thresholds
- Real-time sensor values displayed in app
- Capstan-style paracord system driven by a worm gear motor

### Software Components

- **Arduino Sketch**  
  Reads sensor values, controls the motor, communicates with the app, and stores settings in EEPROM.

- **Android App (Flutter)**  
  Provides manual control, threshold configuration, and real-time data display via Bluetooth.

## Setup Instructions

### Hardware

1. Mount the motor securely and attach the spool to the motor shaft using a hose clamp.
2. Route paracord around pulleys and tie both ends to an L-bracket on the window.
3. Wire all components to the Arduino:

   - DHT11: Digital input
   - Light sensor: Analog input
   - IR sensor: Digital input
   - BTS7960: PWM and direction pins
   - HC-05: TX/RX serial communication
   - ACS712: Analog input

4. Secure all connections and test motor tension.

### Software

#### Arduino

- Upload `Controller.ino` from the `/arduino` directory using the Arduino IDE.
- Ensure required libraries are installed (`DHT`, `EEPROM`, etc.).

#### Android

- Build the Flutter app from `/android_app` using Android Studio or install the precompiled APK.
- Pair your phone with the HC-05 Bluetooth module.
- Launch the app, connect to HC-05, and test functionality.
